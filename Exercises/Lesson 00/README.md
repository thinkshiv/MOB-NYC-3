    |  |           |  |           |  |
    |  |           |  |           |  |
    |  |   Photo   |  |   Photo   |  |
    |  |           |  |           |  |
    |  |           |  |           |  |
    |  -------------  -------------  |
    |                                |
    ----------------------------------

A sample project and PDF description are provided in this folder.

The photos can be laid out in any pattern you please. They can be small square thumbnails, a Pinterest-like "brick" layout, single photos in a wide aspect ratio, etc.

The goal of this assignment is to get you familiar with Xcode and Interface Builder. Keep adding photos (at least 10) until you're comfortable adding images, dragging-and-dropping objects from the Object Library, importing media, and making adjustments with the Inspector Panel.
