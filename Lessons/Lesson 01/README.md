# Lesson 01 - Mobile Interfaces

This lesson focuses on two things:

1. establish a firm foundation for an understanding of mobile app design and development and the tools students will use to create apps, and 
2. complete the course logistics by introducing source control and Github.


## Learning Objectives

* Review and share your apps. Address any questions
* Review concepts from last class.
* Learn to draw and read system diagrams.
* Learn the logistics of our course’s homework submission process with Github.
* Explain the principles of mobile design.


## Lesson Plan

### Review

* Review major concepts from the last class (15min).
* Q+A

### Logistics

* Office hours.
* Slack.
* Github materials.

### Student app show-and-tell

* Show apps to the class.
    * Take screenshots of the simulator and post them to Slack.
    * CMD+SHIFT+4, then SPACE, hover, click
    * Find the screenshot on your Desktop
    * Post the image to Slack so everyone can see.

The Exercise was intended to be a framework for practice. The goal was familiarity with Xcode, Interface Builder, and the Xcode <> Simulator workflow.

Q+A: Any confusing concepts?

### View Breakdown

Breaking Down Views (30 min)

Exercise: Pick a partner. Together, pick an app. Draw a single app screen on the whiteboard, and break down the screen by identifying views found in the Object Library.

### Submitting Homework: Git + Github

_Goal: learn how to read and draw system diagrams (45 min)_

* What kinds of collaboration tools do you use?
* What works well with those tools? What doesn't?
* Diagram how the collaboration works.

_Goal: learn and repeat the git workflow for the class_

* Install SourceTree (Post SourceTree to slack)
* Github account signup
* Terminology
    * Git
    * Source control
    * Repository
    * Clone
    * Fork
    * Commit
    * Status
    * Push
    * Pull
* Workflow
    * Fork the repo on Github
    * Clone to the local machine
    * Plant a snarky comment into ViewController.swift
    * Place exercise into Lesson 00 folder
    * Add the changes to the Index (git add)
    * Commit the changes (git commit)
    * Push to github (git push)
    * Browse in web interface. Look for the snarky comment.


### Hackulator Example Project

* A tour of Hackulator. (30 min)
* Structure of the code.
* Interface Builder files
    * Main storyboard
    * NIBs
* Q+A


### Mobile App Design

    * Less UI real estate
    * Wide range of devices
    * Touch gestures
    * Usage context
    * Network latency
* Gestural Interfaces
* Device-Specific Guidelines
* Mobile Design Patterns
    * Navigation
    * Screen-level actions
    * User onboarding
