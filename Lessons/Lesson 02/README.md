* Views (review)
* View Controllers
* Navigation Controllers
* Scenes

### Introducing Storyboards

* Like website sitemaps.
* Show the entire flow of an app or a portion of an app

A warning about Interface Builder and Storyboards:

There’s a lot of flexibility in Storyboards. Unfortunately, there aren’t many “guardrails” to keep you from doing stuff that simply doesn’t work. In addition, the critical-path features that we need are often obscure and hidden away.

### Website sitemaps

Sitemaps that web designers draw show the structure of the site and describe the “flow” from one page to another.

### Draw a Website Site Map

In pairs, draw a website site map of a website you know, something simple.

### Build a Storyboard App

Build a "vanity app" of yourself, your bio, goals, etc.

We’ll review a few of the views we’ve used before, talk about their “attributes,” and play around a bit more.

We'll also be going over navigation bars, button, _static_ table views, text fields, text views.
