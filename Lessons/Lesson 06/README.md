# Lesson 06 - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

## Objectives

* Define object-oriented programming (OOP)
* Identify and apply object-oriented principles: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
* Differentiate between classes and structs
* Create protocols and apply them to classes, structs, and types

## Lesson Topics

* Classes
    * Defining
    * Instantiating (creating instances of a class, objects)
    * Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism
* Instance properties/methods, type properties/methods, overriding
* Structs
    * Like classes, passed by value
    * All primitives types are structs
* Protocols
